Multi-Model Fluid-Flow Prediction Dashboard
Deep Learning–Driven RHO, U, V, and P Field Prediction for Microchannel Flows

This repository contains an advanced Streamlit web application for predicting and visualizing multiphase fluid-flow fields—including density (RHO), velocity components (U, V), and pressure (P)—using five deep learning architectures:

Simple LSTM

Bi-Directional LSTM

CNN-LSTM Hybrid

ConvLSTM

LST-Net (Sparse Linear Decoder)

All models are integrated into a single interactive dashboard that performs:

✔ Field prediction
✔ Contour visualization
✔ Error analysis
✔ Streamlines
✔ Taylor diagram
✔ Radar chart
✔ Parity plots
✔ Histograms
✔ Model ranking
✔ High-resolution export
✔ Automated PDF report generation

The application is designed for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research, PINNs/MPINNs, LBM simulation post-processing, and multiphase flow analysis.
